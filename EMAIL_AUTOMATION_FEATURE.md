## 💻 Technical Implementation

### **Key Features:**

#### **1. Client-Side Only**
```typescript
// No backend or API routes needed
// Uses browser's mailto: protocol
window.location.href = mailtoLink
```

#### **2. URL Encoding**
```typescript
// Properly encodes special characters
const subject = encodeURIComponent("Anonymous Cyber Incident Report")
const body = encodeURIComponent(`...email content...`)
```

#### **3. Dynamic Content**
```typescript
// Includes actual form data
Incident Type: ${incidentType}
Description: ${description}
Evidence File: ${file ? `"${file.name}"` : "No evidence attached"}
```

#### **4. Form Reset**
```typescript
// Clears all fields after submission
setIncidentType("")
setDescription("")
setFile(null)
```

#### **5. State Management**
```typescript
// Maintains existing UI states
setIsSubmitting(true)  // Shows loading
setShowSuccess(true)   // Shows success dialog
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Issue 1: Email client doesn't open**
**Possible Causes:**
- No default email client configured
- Browser blocking mailto links
- Pop-up blocker active

**Solutions:**
- Configure default email client in OS settings
- Allow pop-ups for the site
- Try different browser

### **Issue 2: Email body is truncated**
**Cause:** Very long descriptions may be cut off

**Solution:** Email clients have character limits for mailto URLs (usually 2000-8000 characters)

### **Issue 3: Special characters look wrong**
**Cause:** Encoding issue

**Solution:** Already handled with `encodeURIComponent()` - should work correctly
