## 🎯 What to Expect

### With Gemini AI (Now Active):

**User:** "I'm being cyberbullied at school. Someone is posting mean things about me."

**Bot:** "I'm really sorry you're experiencing cyberbullying. That must be very hurtful and stressful. Here's what you can do:

1. **Don't respond** to the bully - engaging often makes it worse
2. **Save evidence** - take screenshots of the posts with dates/times
3. **Block the person** on all platforms
4. **Report to the platform** - most social media has anti-bullying policies
5. **Tell a trusted adult** - parent, teacher, or school counselor
6. **Report to your school** - they have policies against bullying

Remember: This is NOT your fault. You deserve to feel safe. Would you like help with any specific step?"

### Features You'll Notice:

✅ **Context-Aware** - Understands the full situation
✅ **Detailed Advice** - Provides step-by-step guidance
✅ **Empathetic** - Shows genuine care and support
