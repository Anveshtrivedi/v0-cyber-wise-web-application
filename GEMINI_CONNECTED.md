## 🔧 What Was Wrong

### Issue: Wrong Model Name
The API route was using an outdated model name that doesn't exist anymore:
- ❌ **Old:** `gemini-pro` (deprecated)
- ❌ **Tried:** `gemini-1.5-flash` (not available)

### Solution: Updated to Latest Model
- ✅ **New:** `gemini-2.5-flash` (stable, latest version)

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. Updated API Route
**File:** `app/api/chat/route.ts`

```typescript
// Before (broken):
const GEMINI_API_URL = 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-pro:generateContent';

// After (working):
const GEMINI_API_URL = 'https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent';
```

### 2. Verified Connection
Tested the API and confirmed:
- ✅ API key is valid
- ✅ Model exists and is accessible
- ✅ Connection successful (200 OK)
- ✅ AI responses working

## ✨ What You'll See

### Before (Fallback Responses):
```
User: "I'm being threatened online"
Bot: "Thank you for sharing that with me. I'm here to listen..."
```

### After (Gemini AI):
```
User: "I'm being threatened online"
Bot: "I'm really sorry you're experiencing online threats. 
     That's a serious situation and you're right to seek help.
     
     Here's what you should do immediately:
     
     1. Don't respond to the threats - engaging can escalate
     2. Take screenshots with timestamps as evidence
     3. Block the person on all platforms
     4. Report to the platform (most have anti-harassment policies)
     5. Tell a trusted adult - parent, teacher, or counselor
     6. Consider reporting to authorities if threats are serious
     
     If you feel in immediate danger, please contact local 
     authorities (112 in India) or emergency services. 
     
     You're not alone in this. Would you like help with any 
     specific step?"
```
