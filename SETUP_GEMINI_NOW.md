## üéØ What to Expect

### ‚úÖ With Gemini AI (After Setup):
```
User: "I'm being threatened online, what should I do?"

Bot: "I'm really sorry you're experiencing online threats. 
     That's a serious situation and you're right to seek help. 
     Here's what you should do immediately:
     
     1. Don't respond to the threats
     2. Take screenshots as evidence
     3. Block the person
     4. Report to the platform
     5. Tell a trusted adult or authority
     
     If you feel in immediate danger, please contact local 
     authorities. You're not alone in this."
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Without Gemini AI (Fallback):
```

     listen and support you. Can you tell me more about 
     what's happening? Remember, you're in a safe space..."
```
